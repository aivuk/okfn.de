title: "Public procurement in Europe needs to enter the digital era"
---
Approximately 20% of the EU’s GDP every year is spent on procuring public goods and it is estimated that the costs that 
are added to a contract due to corruption are around 20-25%. This sounds like a lot and it is even more worrying considering
that this is taxpayers’ money which could be used more efficiently. This is one of the main reasons why more research to 
make public procurement more efficient and transparent needs to be done. This and more is what we are doing with our project
<a href="http://digiwhist.eu">DIGIWHIST</a>. 

<h2>Transparency in procurement starts with the government proactively publishing procurement related information.</h2> We
have done research on the tender data landscape in 35 jurisdictions (including all 28 EU member states, the European 
Commission, Armenia, Georgia, Iceland, Norway, Serbia and Switzerland). None of the countries is performing well at 
publishing their procurement data. In all the countries we looked at the completeness of information in published contract 
announcements was very low. With a few exceptions such as Italy and Estonia, no government publishes information on contract 
implementation making it impossible to know what happens after the contract is awarded - Whether suppliers deliver on time 
and budget?

**Identifying buyers and bidders** is important to prevent collusion in public procurement. In nearly all countries unique 
identifiers for bidders and buyers are missing which makes it difficult to identify who awarded a contract to whom and for 
instance search for the contracts a particular company won. Without unique identifiers it is not possible to conduct 
advanced analytics for identifying suspicious bidding patterns or flag corruption risks. Without unique identifiers the 
recent global push for registering beneficial ownership is almost meaningless as a critical piece of the chain is missing: 
who really has won the contract at the first place.

<h2>Governments need to commit to a tender publication standard.</h2> Procurement data in all 35 jurisdiction is so different that it
makes it nearly impossible to do a comprehensive and effective mapping and comparative analysis. Therefore governments should 
agree on a standard under which tenders are announced on one single platform per country, for example by using the globally 
emerging <a href="http://standard.open-contracting.org/latest/en/getting_started/">Open Contracting Data Standard</a>. This will make the comparison and analysis of procurement announcements 
possible. It will also allow governments to collect reliable data on procurement activities of all authorities. The latter 
is actually an EU requirement and really hard for most of the countries to comply with considering that there are over 
250 000 awarding authorities in the EU. Those authorities have the most diverse ways of publishing tenders and contracts 
and make a collection of the data nearly impossible.

As next steps we will work on publishing Open Data in all 35 jurisdictions and working with existing partners to work 
towards a more standardised procurement data landscape in Europe. If you are interested in joinung us - get in touch <a href="mailto:digiwhist@okfn.de">digiwhist@okfn.de</a>

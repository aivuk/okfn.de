title: "Bulgaria, Lithuania, Poland and Slovenia Rank Highest in OpenBudgets.eu ESIF Data Quality Index."
---
Today OpenBudgets.eu presents the **European Structural Funds Data Quality Index**. **Bulgaria**, **Lithuania**, **Poland** and **Slovenia rank highest** and Ireland, Cyprus, Spain and Austria rank lowest on indicators such as findability of the website and the data, English translation and data format. **Denmark offers the most complete dataset**, providing additional information on projects, locations and beneficiaries in machine readable format. 

Our analysis showed that only 16 of 28 EU member states have an English version of their portal, closed data formats are still common with one PDF and five webapps being used with a total of 22 datasets published so far in the 2014-2020 period. However, in comparison to the 2007 - 2013 funding period, the quality of the data has improved with 3 Member States reporting detailed information on beneficiaries, projects, requested sums, dates, and locations in machine readable format. 

These findings are based on the data collected for [SubsidyStories.eu](http://subsidystories.eu/), which shows **how almost 300 Billion in European Subsidies are spent**. Open Knowledge Germany and Open Knowledge International collected all data for the 2007-2013 and 2014-2020 funding periods, funded jointly by Adessium and OpenBudgest.eu.

EU Regulation No 1303/2013 from December 2013 requires the member states to create a single website providing all viable information on their operational programmes and publishing their beneficiary data in a machine-readable format. Comparative analysis between the two funding periods showed that substantial progress was made with the introduction of this regulation. 

The current funding period shows more machine readable data formats and the data quality has increased. Nonetheless, member states are still slow regarding the dataâ€™s publication and some member states are not complying with regulatory data publication requirements. Furthermore, for the data to become useable for further analysis with which governments can be held accountable for how the funds are spent, the data is still missing crucial information. 

The report makes the following 11 recommendations to improve the quality and usability of the data: 

1. Require member states to make websites available in English 
2. Make CSV or JSON the mandatory format for beneficiary data 
3. Include information on legal form of beneficiary 
4. Require standardised date-notation
5. Provide standardised way to make non-Euro amounts comparable 
6. Provide the following amounts: applied, allocated, and paid out. 
7. Provide project funding broken down by EU Amount, Member State Amount, Third Party Amount, and a total Amount 
8. Provide information on the following dates and milestones in the project: start, finish, payment date and duration 
9. Provide sufficient information to link the beneficiary lists to the programmes by CCI codes 
10. Provide sufficient geographical information for both beneficiary and project location 
11. Provide links to project files

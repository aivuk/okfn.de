    Our work is independent, unbiased, interdisciplinary, and non-commercial. Almost all of our projects survive only due to the volunteers who support them. But volunteer commitment also have their cost. Therefore, we look forward to every donation that allows us to provide support and a good infrastructure to the people advocating open knowledge, open data, and participation under the aegis of the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany. We also accept project-based donations.

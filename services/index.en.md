Today, more and more data is collected and made openly accessible as open data. This enables a wide range of civic, economic, and politcal agents to gain new insights, develop new analyses, increase transparency and accountability, and contribute to a fact-based form of decision-making within their area of expertise. Moreover, the availability of open data serves as the foundation for developers of data-driven tools and services, which in turn results in more efficient and powerful ways to understand, analyse, and share open data. Nonetheless, good know-how is the first condition for anyone who wants to work with and seek value in open data. 

Due to the growing number of data-driven environments, there is an increased demand for **training**, **consulting**, and **services** in relation to **working with open data**. This demand exists within businesses and administrations as well as in editorial offices and civil society organisations. We offer professional trainings and develop individual strategies for your organisation, your business, or your city to help you make the most of open data. 

The **Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland (OKF DE)** is a recognized think tank and do tank, and has been working with an international network of experts from different disciplines for years now. Together we help governments on both communal and national level, civil society organisations and media organisations to work with and make maximal use of open data for their respective goals.

Apart from a strategic consulting session, we offer a wide training program related to working with open data, from absolute beginner to expert levels. The courses are tailored, so that content and format will be adapted to your needs. As partner to the School of Data, we offer the following courses (small selection):

* **Compact introduction into the topic (2-4 hours)**
* **Course for executives and policy makers (1 day)**
* **Open data for administrations (2-5 days)**

Furthermore, we offer the drafting and development of custom-made data-driven software as a service.

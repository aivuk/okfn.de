Today, more and more data is collected and made openly accessible as open data. This enables a wide range of civic, economic, and political agents to gain new insights, develop new analyses, increase transparency and accountability, and contribute to a fact-based form of decision-making within their area of expertise. Moreover, the availability of open data serves as the foundation for developers of data-driven tools and services, which in turn results in more efficient and powerful ways to understand, analyze, and share open data. Nonetheless, good know-how is the first condition for anyone who wants to work with open data and make it usable. 

Due to the growing number of data-driven environments, there is an increased demand for **training**, **consulting**, and **services** in relation to **working with open data**. This comes from businesses and administrations as well as from editorial offices and not-for-profit organizations. We offer professional training and develop individual strategies for your organisation, business, or city to help you make the most of open data. 

The **Open Knowledge Foundation Deutschland (OKF DE)** is a recognized think and do tank and has been working with an international network of experts from different disciplines for several years. Together, we help governments at both local and national level, civil society organisations and media organisations to work with and make full use of open data for their respective goals.

In addition to strategic consulting sessions, we offer a comprehensive open data training program, catering for everyone from absolute beginners to experts. The courses are individually tailored; the content and format will be adapted to your needs. As a partner of the School of Data, we offer the following courses:

* **Compact introduction into the topic (2-4 hours)**
* **Course for executives and policy makers (1 day)**
* **Open data for administrations (2-5 days)**

Furthermore, we offer the drafting and development of custom-made data-driven software.

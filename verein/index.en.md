## Goals

The Open Knowledge Foundation Germany considers itself an active part of German and European civil society. We promote and support civil rights as they are formulated in the German constitution and the European Convention of Human Rights. We especially advocate the prevalence of these rights online. 

Free knowledge helps citizens to obtain information and enables a conscious form of opinion-making. It generates societal and economic value and is, from our point of view, indispensable for a functioning democracy. We strive for a world in which open knowledge is an integral component, online as well as offline. Open knowledge delivers far-reaching societal value. This includes: 

**Better government**: Openness improves governance through increased transparency, efficiency, and participation. We support international efforts such as the [Open Government Partnership](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/) to engage in this domain. 

**Better access to culture**: Openness with regard to cultural material and activities means better access, the possibility to use the material, and the possibility to actively engage with it. We support international efforts such as the [Open Glam Initiative](http://openglam.org/) (Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums) in this domain. 

**Better research and science**: In order to make research more efficient and to ensure its value for society, research results and processes need to be open. We acknowledge the [Budapest Open Access Initiative](http://www.budapestopenaccessinitiative.org) and the [Berlin Declaration](http://openaccess.mpg.de/Berliner-Erklaerung) and strive to encourage the role of the Internet as an instrument for the global basis for scientific discovery. 

**Better economy**: Openness allows for a simplified and accelerated reutilization of open material, data, and content as the basis for the development of innovation, tools, and services. 

[Here we explain](../themen/) in detail how this translates into the focus for our work. 

**Based on our confiction, we pursue the following goals**:

* Advancement of unlimited access to knowledge in all societal areas (politics, culture, economics, science)
* Dissemination of open knowledge and open data as standards
* Advocacy against restriction of knowledge, ie. legislative

**To reach these goals**:
* we provide technical tools that inform citizens about the potential and chances of open data and empower citizens to become active
* we organize educational events and projects and author publications in the domain of science, research, and public relations
* we offer trainings on open data and related technical tools
* we organize working groups that discuss sustainable strategies and applications for the usage and advancement of open knowledge
* we build our community and connect relevant actors

# Freedom of Information (FOI)

Freedom of Information is the civic right to free and open access to information and documents of public authorities.

In Germany, this is regulated by the Informationsfreiheitsgesetz (IFG). It requires public authorities to respond to FOI requests within a month, without the reason for making the request needing to be disclosed. 

> Crypto is defense, IFG is attack! 

Nevertheless, official secrecy persists in many areas. In some federal states, there is no IFG, in others public authorities reply only with some hesitation. We demand an active policy of freely available information in German government agencies. Their work should be transparent and information should be consistently made available to citizens, thereby enabling them to continually monitor their authorities.

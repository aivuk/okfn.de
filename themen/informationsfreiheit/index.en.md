# Freedom of Information (FOI)

Freedom of Information is the civic right to free and open access to information and documents of public authorities.

In Germany, it is regulated by the Informationsfreiheitsgesetz (IFG). It ordinarily requires public authorities to respond to FOI requests within a month, without the need for the asking party to justify its request. 

> Crypto is defense, IFG is attack! 

Nevertheless, official secrecy is predominant in many areas. In some federal states there is no IFG, in others public authorities reply only hesitantly. We demand an active policy of free information in German government agencies. Their work should be transparent and encourage a free flow of information towards citizens, thereby enabling them to monitor their administration.

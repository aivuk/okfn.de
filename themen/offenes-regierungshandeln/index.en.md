# Open Government

>Open government is to be understood as a holistic concept for the vivification of democracy. Transparent government and administration is the basis thereof. However, the point is not only to make the largest possible amount of data available on- and offline, but also, to involve citizens actively into political processes. 

The goal of Open Governent is, to make politics, government, administration and law (= the public sector) more open, transparen, particpatory, and cooperative. This requires a new, transparent and collaboratively designed administrative structure. 

If Open Government is correctly implemented, it will lead to a sustainable change of poltical culture in the intermediate or long term. The existing culture of political participaton, which is merely based on election dates, will develop into a collaborative culture between government and society. The orientation towards Open Government translates into the deconstruction of political apathy and a purely negative culture of protest. The federal government can only profit from such a development. 

We support international efforts in this area as well, such as the [Open Government Partnership](http://www.opengovpartnership.org/).

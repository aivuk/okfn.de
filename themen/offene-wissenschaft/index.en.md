## The German-speaking chapter of the OKF »Open Science« working group

A German Open Science team was founded on 16.7.2014 as part of the OKFestival in Berlin. The goal of the group is to connect activists in the domain of open science as well as furthering the development of legal frameworks for the publication of research results. Additionally, the group is meant to coordinate the development of other international open science groups and to serve as a contact point for researchers, institutions, NGO members, economists and politicians interested in questions related to open science.

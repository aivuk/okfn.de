## The German-speaking chapter of the OKF »Open Science« working group

On the 7th of July 2014, the German chapter of the OKF Open Science working group formed during the OKFestival in Berlin. The goal of the working group is to connect activists in the domain of open science as well as the development of legal frameworks for the publication of research results. Additionally, the working group is meant to coordinate the development of other international open science groups and to serve as a contact point for researchers, institutes, civil society members, economists and politicians interested in questions related to open science.

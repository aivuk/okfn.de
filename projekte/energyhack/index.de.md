Energyhack was the first German hackday on energy data and electricity consumption. The hackday was carried out in cooperation with Stromnetz Berlin GmbH and the Senatsverwaltung f√ºr Wirtschaft, Technologie und Forschung. During the event, the participants created applications and visualisations based on data taken from the Open Data Portal [Netzdaten-Berlin](http://www.netzdaten-berlin.de/).

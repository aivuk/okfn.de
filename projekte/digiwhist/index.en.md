####Fiscal Transparency, Risk Assessment and Impact of Good Governance Policies Assessed.

The allocation of funds through public procurement (services, bulding contracts, and goods) represents a significant share of state expenditure. In the EU, this amounts to about 16% of the GDP. In many cases, the allocation of these contracts is not very transparent. As a result, 20-25% of the volume of orders can be lost to corruption.

In order to change that, we are part of the EU project DIGIWHIST together with 5 partners. On the one hand, we seek to increase the level of trust into the government, on the other, we want to make public procurement in Europe more efficient. To do so, we systematically collect, structure, and analyse information on public procurement.

We develop 35 procurement protals (for the 34 countries and the European Commission) that provide the following main functions:

* downloadable database and documentation
* user-friendly, interactive analysis tools
* users can contribute towards the portals

We are looking for national partners that want to contribute to the portals in their development phase and who help to implement and sustain them. 

The project is financed through EU Horizon 2020.

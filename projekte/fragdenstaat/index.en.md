With Frag den Staat (ask the government), interested citizens can request information from a variety of public sector organisations by making a Freedom of Information (FOI) request. On the project's website, the requests, their current state, as well as the responses are transparently documented and published. With its work, Frag den Staat wants to empower citizens and hopes to further strengthen FOI as a concept. 

FragDenStaat.de is inspired by the British FOI-portal [What Do They Know]( https://www.whatdotheyknow.com/) and is cooperating with other FOI portals around the world.

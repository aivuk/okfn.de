The OpenGLAM working group Germany was founded in the course of the OKFestival 2014 in Berlin. It is part of an international network of people and organisations, that collaboratively promote open cultural heritage. GLAM stands for the digital activities of Galleries, Libraries, Archives, and Museums.

The volunteers behind the OpenGLAM AG plan and organise events and provide information and practical solutions, in order to create awareness for the chances of open cultural heritage data and to support cultural heritage institutions with the process of openiing their data.

The OpenBudgets platform is meant for public administrations, citizens, NGOs, media organisations, and public service companies. In order to provide a scalable platform that is easy-to-use, flexible, and attractive for the different types of users, an open-source software framework and accompanying Software-As-A-Service (SAAS) platform around fiscal transparency and open budgets will be provided.  

As a consortium partner, we contribute to the project in the area of communication and dissemination, as well as through a learning platform for journalists seeking to use the platform.

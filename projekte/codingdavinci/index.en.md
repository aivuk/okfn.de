Coding da Vinci is the first German open cultural data hackathon that brings together cultural heritage institutions and the hacker & designer community to develop ideas and prototypes for the cultural sector and the public. 

More and more galleries, libraries, archives and museums (GLAMs) are digitizing their collections to make them accessible online and to preserve our heritage for future generations. But only if this cultural data is made accessible openly (according to the Open Definition), it can serve as the creative basis for innovative new applications and projects. Coding da Vinci proactively approaches GLAMs to release cultural data openly, in order to offer its participants a platform to experiment and innovate.

Further information is available on the project's website: [codingdavinci.de]( http://www.codingdavinci.de/)

Coding da Vinci is organized by the Open Knowledge Foundation Germany, the [German Digital Library]( https://www.deutsche-digitale-bibliothek.de/), the [Service Center for Digitalization Berlin]( http://www.servicestelle-digitalisierung.de/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=917513) and [Wikimedia Germany](https://wikimedia.de/wiki/Hauptseite).
